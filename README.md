Hello everyone, my name is Patrick Udo
I live in Uyo, Nigeria also from there. I developed an interest in Information Technology when 
I was working as a cyber caf√© Technical Staff after my secondary school education while awaiting my college program.
I look forward to working and learning with you guys!
